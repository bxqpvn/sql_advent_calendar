-- Table Schema:
-- Table: elves
--   elf_id: INT
--   elf_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: vacations
--   elf_id: INT
--   start_date: DATE
--   return_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

select 
  elf_name,
  start_date,
  case
    when return_date is null
    then 'Still resting'
    else to_char(return_date, 'YYYY-MM-DD')
  end
from elves e
left join vacations v
  on v.elf_id = e.elf_id
