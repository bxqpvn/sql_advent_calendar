-- Table Schema:
-- Table: user_goals
--   user_id: INT
--   user_type: VARCHAR
--   goal_id: INT
--   goal_status: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

WITH completed_goals AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    user_type,
    COUNT(goal_status) as goals_count
  FROM user_goals
  WHERE goal_status = 'Completed'
  GROUP BY user_id, user_type)
SELECT
  user_type,
  ROUND(AVG(goals_count),2) as avg_completed_goals
FROM completed_goals
GROUP BY user_type
